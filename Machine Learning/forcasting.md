Successful forcasting
  - lots of data. Most modeles require at least 2 cycles of data
  - how clear are the patterns in the data
  - knowing your dataset
  - use exponential smoothing model for a model that puts more weight on the more recent data

Mean characteristics of time series data
  - trend
  - seasonality
  - mean
  - variance (how much an observation will deviate from the mean)
    * changing variance(heteroscedasting)
    * constant variance(homoscedasting)
